      <p>
        I'm Shibisaran, a backend/cloud-focused developer passionate about building robust APIs,
        scalable services, and clean architectures. I enjoy solving real-world problems with Python
        and Django, and I’m continually exploring cloud technologies and DevOps best practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of coding, I love learning, experimenting with new tools, and contributing to
        projects that make a difference. My goal is to grow into a seasoned backend/cloud engineer
        while maintaining a strong foundation in software craftsmanship.
